# CS540 Project 1 - CPU Scheduling Simulator

##Overview
This project is designed to simulate several different CPU scheduling algorithms (FIFO, SJF, STCF, RR, MLFQ). It does this through a NextJS app deployed to GH Pages through this repo.
The app supports selecting the number of processes, which have randomly generated times. It also allows Round Robin, MLFQ high, and MLFQ low time quanta to be individually chosen. The graphs generated display both wait times and turnaround times, and the totals for each are recorded below the graph. You can save the graphs as a PDF using the requisite button.

###Notes
The gh-pages branch is deployed, this main branch holds the source code.
